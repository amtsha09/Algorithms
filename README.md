# HackerRank-Algorithms
HackerRank's core CS Algorithms Track where all the programs are written in Python.

For performing all these tasks you will need to have certain packages and certain versions of those,
or you can directly copy the environment file and activate the same environment for performing these.

Follow these steps to activate this environment:
	"conda env create -f algo.yml"
	"source activate algo"

The sub-sections of this Track are as follows:

1	Warmup
2	Implementation
3	Strings
4	Sorting
5	Search
6	Graph Theory
7	Greedy
8	Dynamic Programming
9	Constructive Algorithms
10	Bit Manipulation
11	Recursion
12	Game Theory
13	NP Complete
